### Project
- Generation of Synthetic MRI with Deep Optical Flow Field
Estimation for Faster Imaging - [Download link from Texas Digital Library](https://uh-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/10657/5576/NEELI-THESIS-2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=n) - The goal is to eliminate the need to re-taking blurry MR images e.g., frames with motion artifacts by re-creating the frames based on adjacent frames. This will make MR image acquisition faster and easier, especially for the elderly and patients with disabilities.
